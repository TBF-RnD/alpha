# Comparing input methods 
To measure input methods poses several issues. Peak optimal performance might vary quite dramatically on account of factors such as how skilled the user is, which sort of symbols are entered and the physical setting. Furthermore things such as writing while walking or driving might mean a completely different thing than while sitting comfortably at a desk. 

To test writing speed basically what is done is to  construct a simple program that presents strings to the user  for them to write. The softare then logs the time along with the data and a measurement of words per minute and more can be achieved. 

Ideally this is done over several sessions over a period of time. Keep in mind that scores with a method that has been used extensivly on a day to day basis will have an unfair advantage that needds to be compensated. 

## Measuring errors
First of all how do we measure errors. Well the most basic solution would be to design a typing test only accept correct answer and count all the keystrokes. This would give us a measure of how many corrections that have been done in deleted symbols. It is important  to note however  that this method does not take into account correct symbols that have been deleted.

## Measuring trained methods
More recent methods are trained on particular sets. This means that the characteristics of the _"keyboard"_ varies with the text that is written, introducing a new variable. It would seem unfair to train the model on text A from field X and then letting the test subject type text  from text B from field Y.  So for example train the text on the Illiad in greek and let the user write an excerpt from a text by James Joyce''s the Dubliners. On the opposite side of this conundrum it would also be questionable, to train the method on a string such as "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and then let the user enter said string.  

So how do we find a middleground between the extremities with a dynamic input method. The idea of having a dynamic learning input method is just that it is trained for a given theme. One approach is to train the set  of say 90% of a text and providing input texts to be written by the subject from the remaining 10%.  

## Countering learned skill
In the west it would be almost impossible to find a student as a test subject who is not well versed in writing text. So how do we level out the playing field. Well simply by presenting the user with the task of comparing text written with a foreign text using a different alphabet.  So for an English speaker here Russian or Greek would be good options.

## Power law of learning
The Dasher project and the PhD Thesis both do a very solid work of the finer points of theoretically estimating learning according to the power law of learning.
