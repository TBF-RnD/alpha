# Alpha - the Study of Esoteric Input Methods
The alpha project is an attempt to create a framework for research and experimentation on Esoteric input methods. 

As to make the results and technologies available to as many as possible, the code is developed using HTML5+javascript. 

This leads to platform independence and and ease of demonstration. The motive of the project is not so much to create the end all be all solution for text input, but rather to inspire programmers and computer enthusiasts alike to think outside of the box. 

As such the need for a quick way to demonstrate new technologies for an audience with an ever shortening attention span. 

## Perspectives
With the aim of providing an as complete as possible overview of the subject, the area will be studied out of several angles. Starting with going through a list of input methods that seems suitable. 

In the first part Software algorithm the _how_ will be discussed. In the second part on hardware, the _with what_ will be investigated. The third part will focus on what is to be done, i.e. the _why_. As such a matrix of all the parts of the universe we are trying to map out can  be combined and methodologically examined. The fourth part is the meta part, that discusses the finer theoretical points  behind the various methods. Whereas the fifth part deals with the technique of implementing and putting the code into use.

- Fitt's law
- compression algorithms
- user input bandwidth 
- text input models
- neurological latencies
- word 2 vec
- Languages - dialects
- change of mode  cognitive  cost [googgle talk 13;15]

### Technique - a framework for comparision
- Windows integration
- X11 integration
- Android integration
- Protocol for universal symbol emission
- Efficient text rendering
- Marketing novel user interfaces to a broad audiance
- Implementation of math editor
- Web browser extension for 10" interface leveraging readily available consumer hardware
- The UNIX shell as an alphabet, moving the language into the keyboard

## I: Dasher 
The first implementation that is being investigated is the Dasher input method. 

### Proposed improvements  
- Non-linear use of two dimensional screen estate
- Sorting symbols according frequency instead of alphabetic order
- In accordance with Fit's law present more likely symbols closer to the cursor

## II: Chorded
Going back all the way to the mother of all demos, this input method refuses to go away.  

### Pros
- Good bandwidth 
- Small space requiremenets

### Cons
- Steep learning curve, worse with different languages

### Proposed improvements
- Make use of HUD as fall back on user memorization miss
