   Morse code is a [14]character encoding scheme used in
   [15]telecommunication that encodes [16]text characters as standardized
   sequences of two different signal durations called dots and dashes or dits
   and dahs.^[17][2]^[18][3] Morse code is named for [19]Samuel F. B. Morse,
   an inventor of the [20]telegraph.

   The International Morse Code encodes the 26 English letters A through Z,
   some non-English letters, the [21]Arabic numerals and a small set of
   punctuation and procedural signals ([22]prosigns). There is no distinction
   between upper and lower case letters.^[23][1] Each Morse code symbol is
   formed by a sequence of dots and dashes. The dot duration is the basic
   unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a
   dash is three times the duration of a dot. Each dot or dash within a
   character is followed by period of signal absence, called a space, equal
   to the dot duration. The letters of a word are [24]separated by a space of
   duration equal to three dots, and the words are separated by a space equal
   to seven dots.^[25][1] To increase the efficiency of encoding, Morse code
   was designed so that the length of each symbol is approximately
   [26]inverse to the frequency of occurrence in text of the English language
   character that it represents. Thus the most common letter in English, the
   letter "E", has the shortest code: a single dot. Because the Morse code
   elements are specified by proportion rather than specific time durations,
   the code is usually transmitted at the highest rate that the receiver is
   capable of decoding. The Morse code transmission rate (speed) is specified
   in groups per minute, commonly referred to as words per minute.^[27][4]

   Morse code is usually transmitted by [28]on-off keying of an information
   carrying medium such as electric current, radio waves, visible light or
   sound waves.^[29][5]^[30][6] The current or wave is present during time
   period of the dot or dash and absent during the time between dots and
   dashes.^[31][7]^[32][8]

   Morse code can be memorized, and Morse code signalling in a form
   perceptible to the human senses, such as sound waves or visible light, can
   be directly interpreted by persons trained in the skill.^[33][9]^[34][10]

   Because many non-English natural languages use other than the 26 Roman
   letters, [35]Morse alphabets have been developed for those
   languages.^[36][11]

   [38]SOS, the standard emergency signal, is a Morse code [39]prosign

   In an emergency, Morse code can be generated by improvised methods such as
   turning a light on and off, tapping on an object or sounding a horn or
   whistle, making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of
   telecommunication. The most common distress signal is [40]SOS – three
   dots, three dashes, and three dots – internationally recognized by treaty.

Development and history

   pressed, and "off" when it is released. Length and timing of the dots and
   dashes are entirely controlled by the [75]telegraphist.

   Early in the nineteenth century, European experimenters made progress with
   electrical signaling systems, using a variety of techniques including
   [76]static electricity and electricity from [77]Voltaic piles producing
   [78]electrochemical and [79]electromagnetic changes. These numerous
   ingenious experimental designs were precursors to practical telegraphic
   applications.^[80][12]

   Following the discovery of [81]electromagnetism by [82]Hans Christian
   Ørsted in 1820 and the invention of the [83]electromagnet by [84]William
   Sturgeon in 1824, there were developments in [85]electromagnetic
   telegraphy in Europe and America. Pulses of [86]electric current were sent
   along wires to control an electromagnet in the receiving instrument. Many
   of the earliest telegraph systems used a single-needle system which gave a
   very simple and robust instrument. However, it was slow, as the receiving
   operator had to alternate between looking at the needle and writing down
   the message. In Morse code, a deflection of the needle to the left
   corresponded to a dot and a deflection to the right to a dash.^[87][13] By
   making the two clicks sound different with one ivory and one metal stop,
   the single needle device became an audible instrument, which led in turn
   to the Double Plate [88]Sounder System.^[89][14]

   The American artist [91]Samuel F. B. Morse, the American [92]physicist
   [93]Joseph Henry, and [94]Alfred Vail developed an [95]electrical
   telegraph system. It needed a method to transmit natural language using
   only electrical pulses and the silence between them. Around 1837, Morse,
   therefore, developed an early forerunner to the modern International Morse
   code. [96]William Cooke and [97]Charles Wheatstone in [98]England
   developed an electrical telegraph that used electromagnets in its
   receivers. They obtained an English patent in June 1837 and demonstrated
   it on the London and Birmingham Railway, making it the first commercial
   telegraph. [99]Carl Friedrich Gauss and [100]Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1833)
   as well as [101]Carl August von Steinheil (1837) used codes with varying
   word lengths for their telegraphs. In 1841, Cooke and Wheatstone built a
   telegraph that printed the letters from a wheel of typefaces struck by a
   hammer.^[102][15]

   The Morse system for [103]telegraphy, which was first used in about 1844,
   was designed to make indentations on a paper tape when electric currents
   were received. Morse's original telegraph receiver used a mechanical
   clockwork to move a paper tape. When an electrical current was received,
   an electromagnet engaged an armature that pushed a stylus onto the moving
   paper tape, making an indentation on the tape. When the current was
   interrupted, a spring retracted the stylus and that portion of the moving
   tape remained unmarked. Morse code was developed so that operators could
   translate the indentations marked on the paper tape into text messages. In
   his earliest code, Morse had planned to transmit only numerals and to use
   a codebook to look up each word according to the number which had been
   sent. However, the code was soon expanded by [104]Alfred Vail in 1840 to
   include letters and special characters so it could be used more generally.
   Vail estimated the frequency of use of letters in the [105]English
   language by counting the movable type he found in the type-cases of a
   local newspaper in [106]Morristown.^[107][16] The shorter marks were
   called "dots" and the longer ones "dashes", and the letters most commonly
   used were assigned the shorter sequences of dots and dashes. This code was
   used since 1844 and became known as Morse landline code or [108]American
   Morse code.
