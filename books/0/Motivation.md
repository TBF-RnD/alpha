# Motivation 

Keyboards have served us well, why change a winning concept? Well computer technology seems to be evolving with an ever accelerating pace. What seemed to be a good method yesterday might not be applicable efficiently to a new technology. 

## Faster writing
In some instances we'll find that the plain old keyboard model is utterly unsuitable. Take the example of someone tasked  with transcribing what  goes  down in a court, here a  requirement is that text gets written as fast or faster than human speech.  Which means words per minute rates of above 200 wpm. Here we see the use of chorded keyboards where keys are pressed simultaneously. Each chord might represent a symbol, a word or even a phrase. 

## Mobile interfaces
Computers are getting smaller and smaller it seems. The current frontier here seems to be smartwatches, to use those a key based approach simply isn't possible to the devices size. Without optimizations even a virtual onscreen representation of a QWERTY board is impossible.

## VR / AR
The adoption of Virtual Reality at a large scale will be a major milestone in the history of computers. The same goes for Augmented Reality, but given that we just have been freed from our desks and can freely move around as we please, how do we input text efficiently. Especially if instead of only having the input of the fingers as on/off states,  we  can track them in it's entirety,  with gloves. 

Even for those who prefers to remain seated Virtual Reality would obscure the location of the keyboard. As the market have optimized input devices for efficiency in entertainment couldn't the fruits of that optimization used for productive purposes. Just as the gaming industry created GPU's that turned out to be usable in a more general field. 

## 10 feet interfaces
A 10 feet interface is designed for usage on well you guessed it 10 feet. This would describe televisions and projectors and so forth. This is currently dominated by entertainment systems. While operating in this category a keyboard and mouse often turns out to be impractical. As such an alternative system could be used here. We don't have to set the requirements for performance in terms of wpm as high as for productive settings, but an improvement in speed might very well be welcome. 

## Alternative alphabets
English speaking users might very well perform at high speeds in their native language but only after years of training and only in their language. The model is very eurocentric and doesn't take into account other modes of writing such as classic Chinese. Symbols used in Greek are also used frequently in both math and physics. With an accelerating focus on digitization in schools there's a  desperate need for a solution. It's not fair to subject students writing text to have to struggle with the extra cognitive load on inserting mathematical symbols when they ought to be focusing on solving the issues. 

## Disabilities 
Not everyone is physically capable of using a keyboard due to a wide range of illnesses. In many cases optimization might be required on an individual basis. Apart from opening up a new world of opportunities for these people, many of the improvements might be applicable in the more generalized  case. For instance improvements for someone with bad eyesight might be useful in  a situation where the users attention is needed elsewhere, say while driving a car.
