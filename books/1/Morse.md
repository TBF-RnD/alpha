## The genology (sic) of the terminal
Consider the terminal emulator that is an essential part of every modern programmers toolbox. Let's trace it history back a little bit. What the  emulator is doing is emulating an old 70s protocol that in fact traces it's roots to the telegraf and morse code. Stretch this analogy even further and we end up with semaphores providing light speed communication hundreds of years before the internet. Why not as far as smoke signals or whistling for long range near instantanous communication.

We often like to think of the information revolution as a quantum leap forward, but in fact the change is not in what is done but rather how it is done. It's both humbling and useful to look back in time to understand our current situation. Even in terms of political theory I think it would be meaningful to describe societies development in terms of communicational capability. Much like Marxist theory looks at societal development as a function of material wealth, I'd find it interesting to investigate it as a function of net communication bandwidth. 

Interesting as that may be, I am going way off topic. Looking back at how the morse code is constructed can give us some very valuable insights in how data can be transfered between humans. First of all it is interesting as the morse code input is at the extreme end of one specetrum of input mechanism attributes that we want to keep track of. That is there is only one input button. Finding the behaviour at the extreme ends gives   us insight into how models will behave in the range between them. 

## One button, still not strictly binary

## Shannon ???
How to calculate input bandwidth?

## Prediction assisted morse
- luminosity as a function of probabily
- size as a function of probability 
- static /  dual -> split screen
- z-ordering
