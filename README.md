# Alpha - the Study of Esoteric Input Methods
The alpha project is an attempt to create a framework for research and experimentation on Esoteric input methods. 

As to make the results and technologies available to as many as possible, the code is developed using HTML5+javascript. 

This leads to platform independence and and ease of demonstration. The motive of the project is not so much to create the end all be all solution for text input, but rather to inspire programmers and computer enthusiasts alike to think outside of the box. 

As such the need for a quick way to demonstrate new technologies for an audience with an ever shortening attention span. 

## I: Dasher 
The first implementation that is being investigated is the Dasher input method. 

### Proposed improvements  
- Non-linear use of two dimensional screen estate
- Sorting symbols according frequency instead of alphabetic order
- In accordance with Fit's law present more likely symbols closer to the cursor

## II: Chorded
Going back all the way to the mother of all demos, this input method refuses to go away.  

### Pros
- Good bandwidth 
- Small space requiremenets

### Cons
- Steep learning curve, worse with different languages

### Proposed improvements
- Make use of HUD as fall back on user memorization miss
