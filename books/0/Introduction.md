"Functionless art is just tolerated vandalism"
Type O Negative

My interest or dare I say obsession with alternative way of text entry started with a year I had many years ago. My thought was that if we had say a grid of 3x4 and within each cell we placed yet another grid of 3x4 and in those we placed symbols. This would allow  for 12 x 12 = 144 different symbols to be chosen.

So if we compare this to other input methods such as telephone input or selecting from a virtual QWERTY on screen it would almost always result in less keypresses per symbol.

With a "dumbphone" interface we press once for A, two for B, and three for C. If we want to type two B's in a row we are out of luck then we have to wait for a set time before being able to continue.

The remote controll / gamepad setup instead is not to far of conceptually performing a linear search in efficiency. Painfully slow and very unptimized. Imagine writing a Q and then having to go all the way for P for example. 

My system would guarante the use of many more symbols without delays and always with two keypresses. To boot you could use it to type with a foreign  alphabet without having to learn a new layout.

At first I only thought of this as a curiosity or a fun idea and made a quick demo in SDL in c (now long lost). I thought of it as the text entry system 'that could have been". Had it been invented 80 years ago. I dreamt of a different parallel universe where this would have caught on in the 80s and anyone using a 108-key keboard would have been looked as someone riding a horse in central N.Y.

Now the effects of technology dependency had made the market impenetrable and technology lock in had made replacing keyboards futile. The only group of customers I could imagine was one armed people and how do you even market a keyboard for one armed people?

Fast forward a couple of years and I feel very disgruntled with slaving away doing booking systems. Looking through the lens of Feuerbach's theory of alienation you'll see my plight. Had I not truly been passionate about technology and in particular the machine that could make math a science so idealistic it was almost divine be  applied faster, I would not have minded. 

My silly idea turned into something different. It became as a symbol for the artists wish for doing the futile for no other reason that to expand the horizons of what is possible. Maybe even more important a monument for international cooperation in times of increased suspicion. The symbolism of the one armed man so apperant that I'm almost ashamed to use such a vulguar expression.

So I did what everybody would do. Quit my day job to focus on a project with no chance of success. After a few weeks of hacking I had a working X11 prototype with  transparency and stay ontop functionality. To be honest most of the time was spent on trying to dig through the precious little material written on how to grab keys in X11 along with how to implement stay on top functionality. Thankfully everything is open  source and I don't mind digging through code so packages fetched via apt-get source became my most trusted source of documentation.

That being done I decided to be done with computers and left the cold and darkness of Finland and moved to Greece, never to touch a computer again. When in Greece I ran into Greek keyboards of course, reigniting the idea. During the years to come the idea haunted me as a ghost, giving me more and more ideas and giving me more arguments for it's usage. Constantly evolving. The ghost had grown into something akin to a hydra and the only way to kill it was to systematically create the framework to prove or disprove it's efficiency. So all of this resulted in a  comparative study in various input methods.
